# py-kullim2ng
Kullim√§ng created by Silver and Rascy @ init2022<br />
Based on PyGame<br />
We decided to use [an amazing base](https://github.com/blimly/python_koolitus/blob/checkpoint1-game-loop/main.py) by [@blimly](https://github.com/blimly/) for the main engine and just build our own vision from there as we had nothing better to do haha
